To Whom It May Concern, 

Please accept my application for the Biostatistician position with Evidera.  I am qualified for this position due to my technical expertise, my understanding of data analytics, and my ability to communicate results to key stakeholders. Additionally, I have working and professional in a variety of statistical techniques, and have completed extensive coursework in Epidemiology.

After I graduated from Virginia Tech in May 2012 with a degree in Mathematics, I accepted a position with Deloitte as a Data Analytics consultant. At Deloitte I took part in many different business tasks, such as multi-stage sampling and estimation, data modeling preparation, and audit reconciliation. I improved the efficiency of long analyses by using scripting languages such as Python to automate a variety of recurring tasks. 

Following Deloitte, I joined Marriott as a data scientist in their marketing department. I worked to replace the current distance-based sort order algorithm with a probabilistic sort order algorithm, which improved search conversion and online hotel bookings in testing. I also developed a process for scraping review data for Marriott and competitor app review data and applying sentiment analysis and natural language processing to gain insight into customer opinions.

While at Marriott, I was a offered a spot in the Johns Hopkins Masters of Science program for Epidemiology. During this program, I have taken extensive statistics and probability coursework. Additionally, I have worked on several projects, with multiple first author papers in progress. These projects have largely had a Bayesian focus, and include both applied analyses as well as the development of an R package [http://bioconductor.org/packages/CNPBayes/](http://bioconductor.org/packages/CNPBayes/).

Because of my extensive experiences both professionally and academically, I believe I am an ideal candidate for this position. I am hard working and enjoy collaborating with others, both in and out of my field. I am also comfortable working on many tasks at once and having to rapidly shift focus from one project to another. I feel that my greatest strength is my ability to quickly and independently learn new topics in statistics/math or understand new topics in programming.  

Respectfully, 

Jacob Carey
